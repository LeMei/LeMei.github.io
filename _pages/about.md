I am currently a third year **PhD student** at the **University of Sussex** supervised by Prof. David Weir and Dr. Julie Weeds. Before joining Sussex, I obtained my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the **University of Edinburgh** under supervision of Prof. Bonnie Webber and Dr. Thomas Kober (2017-18). I obtained BEng in Computer Science from **Sichuan University** (2013-2017). 

Research interest: Paraphrase Identification, Sentence Meaning Comparison, Domain Generalization.

Apart from research, I enjoy watching anime and playing video games.
