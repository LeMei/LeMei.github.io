I am currently Postdoctoral at University of Copenhagen, working with Prof. Hasti Seifi. I obtained my PhD from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. Guangming Lu and Prof. Yi Zhao (2019-2023). Before joining HITsz, I obtained my MSc in Northeastern University under supervision of Prof. Shukuan Lin(2015-18). My research interests lie at the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, haptic interaction. Now, I am working on sentiment analysis with text, audio, video and haptic signals.
