I am currently Postdoctoral at University of Copenhagen, working with Prof. Hasti Seifi and Dr. Daniel Hershcovich. Previously, I obtained my PhD from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. Guangming Lu and Prof. Yi Zhao (2019-2023). Before joining HITsz, I obtained my MSc in Northeastern University under supervision of Prof. Shukuan Lin (2015-18). 

After completing my master's degree and before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a search algorithm engineer at Xiaomi Cloud Platform for about a year and a half. During my PhD, I interned at DAMO Academy for more than six months.

My research interests lie at the multimodal learning, affective computing, machine learning, haptic interaction. Now, I am working on affective computing tasks with text, audio, video and haptic modalities. If you need my mentorship for your research projects, feel free to reach out !
