I am currently Postdoctoral Researcher at University of Copenhagen, working with Prof. Hasti Seifi and Dr. Daniel Hershcovich. Previously, I obtained my PhD from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by Prof. Guangming Lu and Prof. Yi Zhao. Before joining HITsz, I obtained my MSc in Northeastern University under supervision of Prof. Shukuan Lin. 

After completing my master's degree and before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a search algorithm engineer at Xiaomi Cloud Platform for about a year and a half. During my PhD, I interned at DAMO Academy for more than six months.

My research interests lie at the multimodal learning, affective computing, machine learning, haptic caption. Now, I am working on haptic captioning, multimodal learning and LLMs. Apart from research, I enjoy painting, shopping, and watching BiliBili.
